HybridSN: Exploring 3-D–2-D CNN Feature Hierarchy for Hyperspectral Image Classification 🌄🔍

Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification is widely used for the analysis of remotely sensed images. 🔬📸 Hyperspec- tral imagery includes varying bands of images. 🌈🖼️ Convolutional neural network (CNN) is one of the most frequently used deep learning-based methods for visual data processing. 🧠💻 The use of CNN for HSI classification is also visible in recent works. 📚🔍 These approaches are mostly based on 2-D CNN. On the other hand, the HSI classification performance is highly dependent on both spatial and spectral information. 🌐📊 Very few methods have used the 3-D-CNN because of increased computational complexity. This letter proposes a hybrid spectral CNN (HybridSN) for HSI classification 🚀📡. In general, the HybridSN is a spectral–spatial 3-D- CNN 🌀🌟 followed by spatial 2-D-CNN. The 3-D-CNN facilitates the joint spatial–spectral feature representation from a stack of spec- tral bands 🌌🎨. The 2-D-CNN on top of the 3-D-CNN further learns more abstract-level spatial representation. 🖼️✨ Moreover, the use of hybrid CNNs reduces the complexity of the model compared to the use of 3-D-CNN alone. 🔀📉 To test the performance of this hybrid approach, very rigorous HSI classification experiments 🧪🔬 are per- formed over Indian Pines, University of Pavia, and Salinas Scene remote sensing data sets. 🛰️🏞️ The results are compared with the state- of-the-art hand-crafted as well as end-to-end deep learning-based methods. 💡🤖 A very satisfactory performance is obtained using the proposed HybridSN for HSI classification. 🏆🌟
